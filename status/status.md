Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

I am almost finished with my project. I have already implemented my ten metrics for distinguishing the 20 languages and I am halfway finished with the survey questions.
I have already implemented the system that adapts to the languages the user already speaks.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

I still need to do some simple restrictions, like preventing the user from advancing until they provide responses and providing two of the same response. I need to finish the survey questions.
I still need to design the interface for viewing the suggestions for next languages after the user completes the survey.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

I have encountered problems in my general layout and navigating GET and POST,
but I think this was more reflective of my lack of comfort and understanding with Python/Flask and not that it was actually a difficult issue to resolve.
I was trying to access responses from previous routes, and this is obviously impossible, so I needed to rework things a bit. It is working perfectly now.
