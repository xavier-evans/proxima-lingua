    My project uses Python and Flask, and thus to start the website, you must run flask run first.
This brings you to a login/registration page, and you will need to create an account to use the website.
Upon registering or logging in, you will arrive at in introduction page that explains the general
mechanism for the evaluation. You can begin taking the survey by clicking the Begin button below the
metrics or by using the navigation bar and clicking Survey. You can navigate to Results preliminarily if
you want, however, before taking the survey, you will see a typical format and not your customized
results.
    Once you have navigated to Survey, you will see the option to input the number of langauges on the
list that you speak. You input this number and then hit the button to input the languages themselves.
You should input the languages in the order of proficiency. Thus, if Spanish is your best foreign
language, followed by Chinese and then Portuguese, you should input Spanish, then Chinese, and then
Portuguese. At long last, you can begin the survey.
    The survey is remarkably straightforward. There are 50 questions in total, and you simply indicate
the extent to which you agree with each of the statements. There is a progress bar at the top of each
page to let you know how much is left (because it is a long survey). You should respond to all of the
statements, and once you complete all ten pages, you will advance to the newly updated results page. It
is important to understand how to interpret the results, but they are explained well on the website. Your
best match is the first language listed, and the worst match is at the bottom, everything else falling
somewhere in the middle. You can repeat the survey as many times as you like, and the results will update
with each new completion. It is a pretty simple tool and there are complete explanations on the website
for how to navigate. I hope this helps!
