# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Choosing Your Next Language

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A website that helps you choose what language to learn next.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

My website will be a survey with several multiple choice questions that will gradually lead you to a suggestion or list of suggestions for the next language that you should learn.
I find it difficult to decide because all languages have so much inherent beauty and enticing reasons for learning them.
This tool gives more objectivity to the selection process and forces you to look at how good of a cultural fit the language is for you.

## If planning to combine CS50's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to CS50, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TFs below.

TODO, if applicable

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

multiple choice questions, give a suggestion for the next language

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

input languge(s) already spoken and change result based on that

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

allow user to toggle whether they want to learn a language as distinct as possible from their currently spoken language(s) or similar

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I will modify homepage for this project. It should be relatively straightforward since the interface for a multiple choice test is reather simple.
I will want to get more comfortable with bootstrap and other tools for UI design so my website looks as beautiful as it is functional.
I will also want to make sure I understand how to interweave all the pages together so you can move between them relatively freely depending on the answer.
